:smiley: *BattleshipAI is a fresh, entertaining, challenging and instructive take on the classic game that most people got to appreciate as a way to get through boring classes back in school. Though our version might just make up for a fascinating class itself.
We deployed state of the art web technology, yet kept the architecture light and elegant enough to provide the opportunity to gain insight into the overall logic of the code as well as the concepts that drive the different AI characters by investing just a little bit of time. The strength of the bots resulting from their strategies range from purely random to maximal optimization of in-game probabilities including computing the entire tree of possible setups. If you have no interest in computer science whatsoever, you are destined to be enticed by the captivating gaming experience nevertheless. If you do however have an interest in AI and alike, you are highly likely to enjoy both playing the game as well as digging into its mechanics.*
