# BattleshipAI
A battleship game (Schiffe versenken) with a learning AI in the making. As part of the AI course with Prof. Franz Kurfess in the summer term 2015 at hm.edu.

:smiley: **marketing blurb**: 
BattleshipAI is a fresh, entertaining, challenging and instructive take on the classic game that most people got to appreciate as a way to get through boring classes back in school. Though our version might just make up for a fascinating class itself.
We deployed state of the art web technology, yet kept the architecture light and elegant enough to provide the opportunity to gain insight into the overall logic of the code as well as the concepts that drive the different AI characters by investing just a little bit of time. The strength of the bots resulting from their strategies range from purely random to maximal optimization of in-game probabilities in combination with applying patterns from cross-game learning. A dev mode offers insight into the ‘thinking’ of the various bot types and provides the ability to run statistical analysis on their success-rate in comparison to other bot types or humans. 
Client-side and server-side code are accessible on GitHub, where an extensive wiki can be found as well. 
If you have no interest in computer science whatsoever, you are destined to be enticed by the captivating gaming experience. If you do however have an interest in web apps, AI and alike, you are highly likely to enjoy both playing the game as well as digging into its mechanics. 
We developed this as part of the AI course with Prof. Franz Kurfess in the summer term 2015 at the University of Applied Sciences Munich.
